# Flappy Bird Clone Game

This project contains a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game. The main objective of the game is to keep the bird flying for as long as possible by navigating it through gaps between pipes. The project is developed using the Java programming language and the LibGDX game development library.

## Features

- Players can control the bird's altitude by tapping or clicking the screen.
- Obstacles are generated with random positions and heights, making each gameplay session unique.
- The game's speed increases over time, raising the level of challenge.
- A scoring system is implemented to record and display players' high scores.

## How to Play

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Control the bird's altitude by tapping or clicking the screen. Each tap will make the bird ascend a certain height.
3. Navigate through the gaps between the obstacles. Colliding with obstacles ends the game.
4. Your highest score is recorded and displayed when you finish your game session.
